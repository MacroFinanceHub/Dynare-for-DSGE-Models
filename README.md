# Dynare-for-DSGE-Models
thesis.mod file is my Master's Thesis in 2012. It is a DSGE model with a financial accelerator mechanism. To execute it you need Dynare installed on Matlab. I also included my thesis along with the code so that understanding the model will be easier. 
The other two mod files are the codes of the papers with the same name. The papers are  in pdf format. These two papers and their codes can also be found online. That is in fact how I obtain them in the first place.
